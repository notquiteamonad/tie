# TIE Vault

This folder is a vault intended to be opened in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

It contains a series of interlinked high-level documents about the process TIE follows to generate TS definitions. It is **less likely** to be up to date than the in-code documentation, and should be taken as a high-level reference only.

The start point is [[The Process]].
