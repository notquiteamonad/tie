# The Process
Initially, don't [[watch files]], we'll just work from a single fire and forget mechanism.

1. Get all the files in a given directory (via a [[CLI args|CLI arg]])
2. Find `main` and [[Processing `main`|process it]]
3. Find all the ports and [[Processing ports|process them]]
4. Write into a `.d.ts` file
